# AHBExchangeRate – Real-Time Currency Tracker

🔐 **Configuration Notes**

The API access token is currently stored in Info.plist for simplicity during development.

In a production-ready setup:

All sensitive configurations (e.g., API base URL, access key, host, security settings) should be stored in a centralized configuration file.

This configuration file should be secured in a private repository and fetched securely during the build process (e.g., via CI/CD).

This approach improves security, scalability, and environment management.

## ⚠️ Token Limitation Notice

The **auto-refresh feature (every 5 seconds)** is implemented but **disabled** due to limitations of the free plan from `exchangerate.host`.

## 💡 Overview

AHBExchangeRate is an iOS application that allows users to:

- View **real-time exchange rates**
- See **daily percentage changes** (+/-)
- **Add or remove** currencies to a personalized watchlist
- Group assets into **Popular Currencies** and **Cryptocurrencies**
- **Search** available assets dynamically
- Swipe to **delete** currencies
- Automatically **persist selections**

## 🧱 Architecture

The app is built using **Clean Swift (VIP)** architecture:

| Component     | Responsibility                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ViewController| Manages UI and user interaction                |
| Interactor    | Handles business logic                         |
| Presenter     | Transforms data into view-ready formats        |
| Router        | Manages scene transitions                      |
| Worker        | Executes API/network tasks                     |

The app also applies **Atomic Design** principles:

| Level      | Example                        |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Atoms      | AHBLabel, CurrencyIconView     |
| Molecules  | AddAssetCell                   |
| Organisms  | AddAssetViewController         |

## 🔁 Networking

Exchange rate data is fetched from:

- `/live` endpoint: Real-time currency quotes
- `/change` endpoint: Daily change percentages

Responses are parsed into:

- `ExchangeRateAPIModel`
- `ChangeAPIModel`

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

User selection is stored locally using:

```swift
UserDefaultsManager.shared.selectedCurrencyCodes
- Ensures the list is persisted across launches
- Controlled by UserDefaultsManager.swift
